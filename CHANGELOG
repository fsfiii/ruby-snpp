Changes in v0.3:
================
+ :message and :debug are now attr_accessor
+ now uses Minero Aoki's updated setup.rb instead of install.rb

Changes in v0.2:
================
+ added add_pager method for specifying multiple pagers
+ SNPP.initialize now handles a block (yields an open snpp connection that
  it will close after the block has completed)
+ added :message as an attr_writer
+ SNPP.send now can be called without any parameters if the pager and message
  have already been set
+ added a paging program, bin/fpage.rb, that's more useful than test_snpp.rb
